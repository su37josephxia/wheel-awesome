# Make wheels every day

## ![Talk is cheap. Show me the code.](assets/talk.jpeg)

Linux founder Linus Torvalds mentioned in an email to linux-kernel's mailing list on August 25, 2000:

### There is no proof of the word, the code is the proof.
I can make wheels without saying a word. Are you afraid to ask me in an interview?
One wheel a day, and just do it.
